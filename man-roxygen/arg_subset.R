#'
#' - `NULL`: no subsetting, i.e. use whole dataset
#' - `integer`: subset to these rows before computations;
#'   `NA` values throw a warning and are not included
#' - `logical`: subset to rows where this is `TRUE` before computing counts;
#'   `NA` values throw a warning and are not included; the `logical` vector
#'   must have as many elements as the dataset has rows
